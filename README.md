### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a hobby developer from Germany. I have tried many things over the years but my main journey is:  
â”‚  
â—‡ `It all started with Python. I wrote algorithms and data manipulation programs.`  
â”‚  
â—‡ `I learned HTML, CSS and made basic visual sites`  
â”‚  
â—‡ `I used C# in Unity and made small games (Also at my school; see `[ProjektKursInfo](https://github.com/Sneezy123/ProjektKursInfo)`)`  
â”‚  
â—‡ `I learned Java at school`  
â”‚  
â—‡ `I picked up Python again and made more advanced stuff (Manim animations); all for fun and no real projects`  
â”‚  
â—‡ `I had an idea about an app so I learned React and turned it into reality (Still working on it)`  
â”‚  
â—‡ `needed to learn JavaScript (more than the basics); see `[myKrefeld](https://github.com/Sneezy123/myKrefeld)` and `[Hosted Version](https://my-krefeld.vercel.app)  
â”‚
